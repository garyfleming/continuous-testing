# Previously on...

^ A year or two ago I wrote a talk called The Board Whisperer. It's about Kanban and using boards to improve your process, and have that be a reflection of your team's improvements. Improve team, improve process, improve team.

# Start...

^ TODO starting board
^ Don't need to have seen that talk. But the important bit is...
^ TODO going from 3-col kanban (describe...) to

# End...

^ TODO End board
^ To something more involved. There's a lot in here. We'll ignore most of it.

# Sad Face

^ TODO end board?
^ TODO throwaway comment re: not liking the test column. It was a mistake. A few people asked about this. Why is a test column not great?

# Why is a test column not great?

^ This talk is an answer to that question. Tried many different ways of phrasing that question, "test column suboptimal", "test column bad sign", "test column old-fashioned." I don't think any of them are quite right. Having one or more columns for test is pretty traditional. Who has one? You shouldn't feel bad for having one. But let me talk a bit about why I think we can move on from them, under the right circumstances.

# Reasons

* A CI/CD world. -- Briefly cover each. Why this is fundamentally changing testing. Can't be gatekeepers any more.
* Testing -- Lots of different kinds, but throwing stuff over the fence to test at the end probably not tenable any more.

^ TODO split into longer slides each
^ TODO fairly sure I had more here

# What can help.

* Feature Toggles -- Problem it solves, how they work, benefits, pitfalls
* Example Mapping -- Problem it solves, how they work, benefits, pitfalls
* Testers as Coaches -- working with the team to consider quality, rather than just checking at the end. Testers *not* responsible for quality. They, instead, provide a perspective for quality (clumsy wording?) that teams then use to build quality.
