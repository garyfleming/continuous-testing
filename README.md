# Continuous Testing

Statement (100 chars): Only testing after development drives dysfunction. Let's get quality earlier and collaboratively. Let's get rid of the "Test" column.

Key learnings:
* Learn why a Test column on your board might not be helping you
* See how to change your teams process to get testers involved earlier.
* Explore Example Mapping and User Story Mapping as techniques for getting questions of quality asked earlier.
* See how we can go beyond our tools to have meaningful conversations about doing better.

Testing is an afterthought in far too many teams, and is often visualised in our Kanban boards as simply being after development. By only involving testers after software has already been developed, we lose the opportunity to have valuable insights into what might go wrong or to explore areas that developers and product owners have yet to consider.

Moreover, in a Continuous Delivery world, this is simply no longer viable: we need quality in upfront and throughout our work. We no longer have time to findÂ bugs later and redevelop.

We need quality beyond testing. We need testers involved throughout the process.

In this talk, I'll show you how to break out of the test column, and provide you with tools to use (like Example Mapping) in order to work better with your entire team. Through collaboration, communication, and exploration, I'll show you how to help your team from the very beginning of development, not just at the end.
